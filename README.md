# Original Survival Shooter project by Unity Technologies, but updated to Unity 2019.3

- Original assets
- Updated to Unity 2019.3
- Code comments by Unity developers

## Changes:

- Updated namespaces for navmeshes
- Changed obsolete scene management code
- Turned off auto generate option for lightmapper
- Baked nav mesh that was not there

Why would I change lightmapping mode to manual? Generally, I don't want it to rebake lights every time anything is changed. Most importantly, however, autogenerated lightmaps are stored in your computer's cache, while manually generated lightmaps are saved locally in the project files. It means that whenever this project is copied by anyone else, there will be no need to rebake lights.
